First time you run Clicky.py it will create a folder of jpeg images before opening the first image. If this folder already exists then this step will be skipped.

When the first image appears click a point on the screen. Immediately the next image will appear (the image is one second later than the first in the video). Keep clicking and the pixel locations of your clicks will be recorded.

When there are no more images the window will automatically close. A folder will be created containing a file named according to the Ant_ID variable (i.e. you want to change this for each ant tracked). This file contains the locations of all your clicks.
